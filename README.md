# Vue Todo

### A basic todo list application for maintaining the basics of the Vue framework.

I build this application to begin exploring the Vue framework. Really only having developed user interfaces with React, learning Vue has posed many challenges in breaking away from a "React Work flow" (for lack of a better term), apprehending new syntax and patterns. Makes sense to start with a basic todo list app :)

I followed along with a YouTube tutorial, modifying parts along the way. Links below:
